    "## Predicting NBA players' scoring average in Regular Season and Playoffs using Machine Learning.\n",
    "In this notebook, I am going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the scoring average of players\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem definition How well can we predict the scoring of each player given its characteristics and categories provided by Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data The data was adapted from that of Data from Basketball Reference. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats\n",
    "\n",
    "There is 2 dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "2021-2022 NBA Player Stats Regular Season CSV 2021-2022 NBA Player Stats Playoff CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted the scoring Per Average.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.\n",
