Project Title: NBA Players Scoring Prediction Regression

Description:
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the scoring performance of NBA players using regression techniques. By utilizing historical player statistics and game data, the project aims to develop accurate models that can forecast a player's scoring output in future games.

Key Features:

* Data Collection: Scrapped and collected comprehensive NBA player data from Kaggle, including game statistics, player attributes, and team information.
* Data Preprocessing: Performed extensive data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for regression modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to gain insights into the relationship between player attributes, game factors, and scoring performance.
* Regression Models: Developed and evaluated various regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to predict player scoring.
* Model Evaluation: Employed appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the developed models.
* Feature Importance: Investigated the significance of different features in predicting player scoring and identified the most influential factors.
* Model Deployment: Demonstrated how to deploy the trained model in a production-like environment to make real-time scoring predictions.


This project serves as a valuable resource for basketball enthusiasts, data scientists, and researchers interested in understanding and predicting NBA players' scoring abilities. The code and documentation provided can be utilized as a foundation for further research and development in the field of sports analytics.
